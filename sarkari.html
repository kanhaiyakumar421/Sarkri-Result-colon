            3. Banking Jobs :The banking sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India. It's not surprising that
            jobs in government-approved banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), Allahabad Bank, HDFC, and ICICI are
            highly sought after. A job in the banking sector could either be a clerical position such as typists, data
            entry operators, cashiers, or clerks or a probationary officer (PO) role. As a PO, the candidate will be
            under probation during the training period and will be hired following the probation based on performance.
            During the training period, the candidate will be trained in accounting, finance, billing, investment, and
            revenue collection. A PO role allows opportunities for career growth to middle and senior management based
            on performance and additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about INR 57,000
            including allowances.

            Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, etc. A job in the NDA comes with strict restrictions on age, physical, and
            vision standards. Cadet trainees receive a stipend of INR 56,100 per month. Allowances and promotions will
            increase this salary. There are also several agricultural, engineering, and research jobs with their own set
            of rules and requirements. These can get very complicated, but Sarkari Result does all the work for you and

        </div>
        <p class="line1">India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many decades. People prefer
            Government jobs as their career option considering the wide variety of benefits that are associated with
            these. ‘Sarkari Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people across the nation, and only a few are lucky to
            land up with such jobs. People tend to take pride in having a Sarkari or Government job.

        </p>
        <p class="line1">Government jobs hold the kind of authority not found in private jobs. These also offer job
            security for a lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a
            person to go through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination, interview and sometimes
            even physical examination. These are competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get
            into a coveted Government job.

        </p>
        <div class="india">
            How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?

        </div>
        <p class="line1">There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly competitive. The Times of
            India said it best when they said that the numbers are staggering:

        </p>
        <p class="line1">
            2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.

        </p>
        <p class="line1">2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal
        </p>
        <p class="line1">200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in Maharashtra.
        </p>
        <p class="line1">When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions, they received
            more than 19 million (1.9 crores) job applications.

        </p>
        <p class="line1">With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in the number of people
            hired by the government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost
            32,000 jobs. There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government. This
            creates an extremely competitive environment. Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari
            Result and understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the crowd. These are of course
            some of the most coveted roles in India and are extremely competitive.

        <p class="india">Sarkari Exam for Government Jobs
        </p>
        <p class="line1">Sarkari or Government exams are conducted for various positions in the state as well as central
            Government. There are various groups in Government jobs and candidates can apply for either of these groups,
            depending on their qualifications. Group A mostly comprises of managerial roles and are considered to be the
            highest level of jobs. Group B is for Gazetted officers. To clear the Group B exam, one has to make the UPSC
            exam. Most seats under Group B are filled via promotions, so only limited seats are left for entrance via
            exam. Group C and D are for public servants who have non-supervisory roles.
